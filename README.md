Methodology
Data Preprocessing
Handling outliers: Identify and deal with outliers in the dataset using appropriate techniques such as Z-score or IQR method.
Feature scaling: Scale numerical features to ensure uniformity and improve model performance.
Feature engineering: Create new features or transform existing ones to capture additional information and improve model interpretability.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Feature importance analysis: Determine the most significant features affecting the prediction of dementia risk.
Correlation analysis: Explore the relationships between different features and their impact on the target variable.
Distribution analysis: Examine the distribution of target variable and features to understand the data characteristics.
Model Evaluation
Cross-validation: Implement k-fold cross-validation to assess model performance and generalize well to unseen data.
Hyperparameter tuning: Optimize model hyperparameters using techniques like grid search or random search to improve predictive accuracy.
Model comparison: Compare the performance of different machine learning algorithms and identify the best-performing model.
Results and Discussion
Model performance: Present the accuracy scores, precision, recall, and F1-score of each model to evaluate their effectiveness in predicting dementia risk.
Key findings: Discuss the insights gained from the analysis, including significant features, correlations, and potential risk factors for dementia.
Limitations: Address any limitations or challenges encountered during the project, such as data quality issues or model constraints.
